# 🎬 Netflix Clone - DevSecOps Project

![Architecture Diagram](assets/arch-diag.gif)


A **complete end-to-end DevSecOps project** showcasing how to automate, secure, and monitor infrastructure and applications using modern tools — from **Terraform to Kubernetes**, **Jenkins to Trivy**, and everything in between.  

Built to demonstrate **real-world DevSecOps workflows** for CI/CD, cloud automation, security integration, and observability — all in one Netflix-themed application. 🍿  

---

## 🚀 Project Overview

This project simulates a real enterprise-grade setup where a **React-based Netflix Clone** is deployed and managed through a **secure, automated DevOps pipeline**.

### 🌐 Key Features
- **Infrastructure as Code** with Terraform (AWS provisioning)
- **State management** using Terraform Cloud  
- **CI/CD automation** with GitHub Actions and Jenkins  
- **Security Scanning** with Trivy & OWASP Dependency Check  
- **Containerization** with Docker  
- **Kubernetes Deployment** (unmanaged cluster setup)  
- **Monitoring Stack** for Jenkins, Kubernetes, and the app itself
